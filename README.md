# CoverageAnalysisAndPlottingSuite
CAPS (Coverage Analysis and Planning Suite) is a comprehensive tool designed for wireless network engineers, survey teams, and researchers to perform efficient Line-of-Sight (LoS) coverage analysis and planning. With a powerful graphical interface and real-time map integration.
CAPS enables users to:
Load and visualize base station and survey point data on interactive maps.
Perform multi-site coverage analysis using topographic and terrain data.
Automatically generate professional survey reports in PDF format with annotated figures and LOS diagnostics.
Interface with GNSS receivers such as u-blox M10 for live geolocation tagging.
Log survey progress, remarks, and overlay critical data such as city boundaries and roads.
The app supports geospatial zooming, multi-resolution basemaps, intelligent redraw handling, and user-defined annotations for site planning and documentation. CAPS is optimized for field use as well as offline post-survey reporting, streamlining the full coverage survey lifecycle from planning to documentation.
